# Ghost API Mocking with Retrofit

Ghost is a powerful library that helps you mock API responses using JSON files when working with Retrofit. It allows you to simulate different API responses and status codes, making it easier to test your Android application without relying on actual backend services.

## Features
- Mock API responses using JSON files stored in the `assets` directory.
- Support for multiple status codes to simulate different server responses.
- Easily integrate with Retrofit for seamless API mocking during development and testing.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Add the Ghost dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.somepackage:ghost:1.0.0'
}
```
